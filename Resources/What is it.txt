This website design is a **dashboard-style interface** for tracking **Long Covid clinical trials**. Below is a structured breakdown to estimate web development costs:

### **1. General Overview**
- **Type**: Clinical trial monitoring dashboard
- **Main Functionalities**:
  - Data visualization (pie charts)
  - Interactive data table
  - Trial preview panel
  - Download feature

### **2. UI/UX Design**
- **Header**:
  - Title: "Long Covid Trials Dashboard"
  - Privacy button (just a disclaimer, no settings)
  - Last update date (dynamic content)

- **Main Content**:
  - **Total Number of Trials**: Displayed dynamically
  - **Two Pie Charts**:
    - One representing recruitment status (e.g., Authorized, Recruiting)
    - Another showing trial types (e.g., Pharmacological, Rehabilitation)
  - **Data Table**:
    - Columns: Trial ID, Category, Country, Recruitment Status, Public Title
    - Sortable and filterable rows
    - Color coding for different trial statuses

- **Side Panel**:
  - Preview box (displays details when a trial is selected)
  - Expandable/collapsible (indicated by a "+" button)

- **Download Button**:
  - Allows downloading trial data (CSV, Excel, or PDF)

### **3. Technical Implementation Considerations**
- **Frontend**:
  - Likely built with **React, Vue, or Angular** for interactivity
  - **D3.js or Chart.js** for pie charts
  - **DataTables.js or AG Grid** for the trial table

- **Backend**:
  - Database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB) for trial data
  - API (Node.js, Django, or Flask) for fetching/updating trial records
  - Scheduled updates for the "Last update" field

- **Hosting & Security**:
  - No need for Secure handling of clinical data (GDPR/HIPAA compliance not needed public data)
  - No user authentication
  - Cloud hosting (AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud)
  
 The is NO user management, no admin access or whatever. The goal is only to view and access these consolidated public data. So no login and logout or whatever
Also, based on your experience, how much money would you think it would be reasonable for a webdev to make a function v1 with the map and the clickable/previewable table?

Factoring in french price (probably half of US rates),
the dev being naturally favorable to the Long Covid cause (being either directly or indirectly impacted)
and the money coming from poor patients pockets?
